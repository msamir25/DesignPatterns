The chain of responsibility is a design pattern described in the book Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software. This pattern allows a request to be passed along a chain of objects until one of the objects can handle the request or the chain ends.

As the name suggests, each object in the chain is responsible for handling a specific task or request. If an object receives a request that it cannot handle, it passes the request to the next object in the chain.

Using this design pattern improves the flexibility and reusability of the code. Request-handling processes can modify the request or check its requirements without affecting the overall behavior of the system. This makes it easier to maintain and extend the code over time.

Pros:
    
    1-Flexibility: The pattern allows you to add, remove, or modify objects without affecting the overall behavior of the system.
    2-Reusability: Objects in the chain can be reused in other chains or other parts of the system, reducing development time on subsequent projects.
    3-Open/Closed Principle: The chain of responsibility design pattern follows the open/closed principle, which means you can add new objects to the chain without modifying   
          the core logic.
    4-Decoupling: The pattern decouples the sender of a request from its receiver, allowing you to change the handling of the request without affecting th

Cons:

   1- Performance: Since each request passes through multiple objects, it can affect the overall performance of the system.
   2-Complexity: A chain involves multiple objects that interact with each other, increasing the complexity of the system.
   3- Debugging: Debugging can be challenging when requests are passing between objects.
